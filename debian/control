Description: The GNU C preprocessor (cpp)
 The GNU C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically
 by the GNU C compiler to transform programs before actual compilation.
 .
 This package has been separated from gcc for the benefit of those who
 require the preprocessor but not the compiler.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default GNU C preprocessor.

Package: gcj
Section: java
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: cpp (>= ${version:cpp}), gcj-jdk (>= ${version:gcj}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: The GNU Java compiler (transitional package)
 GCJ is a front end to the GCC compiler which can natively compile both
 Java(tm) source and bytecode files. The compiler can also generate class
 files.

Description: The GNU Java bytecode interpreter (transitional package)
 GIJ is not limited to interpreting bytecode. It includes a class loader which
 can dynamically load shared objects, so it is possible to give it the name
 of a class which has been compiled and put into a shared library on the
 class path.

Description: Link time only library for use with gcj
 A fake library that is used at link time only.  It ensures that
 binaries built with the BC-ABI link against a constant SONAME.
 This way, BC-ABI binaries continue to work if the SONAME underlying
 libgcj.so changes.

Description: gcj and classpath development tools for Java(TM)
 GCJ is a front end to the GCC compiler which can natively compile both
 Java(tm) source and bytecode files. The compiler can also generate class
 files. Other java development tools from classpath are included in this
